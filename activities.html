                            Something interesting is a cruise that is being arranged every day, the ship is looking like a pirate ship, the ship crew is also wearing pirate clothes and the music that is being played is from the movie “Pirates of the Caribbean”. The cruise takes place all around the island emphasising some caves and stops in some nice beaches so the visitors can dive in the outstanding waters and perhaps take some photos.

                            It is nice to swim on those crystal blue waters but even better is, to enjoy some water sports. I think that one of the most exciting sea sports is driving the jet ski. You can rent a jet ski either for one person or two and be ready to welcome the adrenaline. There is no need to have any kind of licence, the only requirement is to be older than 18 years old.
