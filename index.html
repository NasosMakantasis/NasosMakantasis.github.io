                    <p>The presence of the <em> Caretta - Caretta </em> turtles in Zakynthos is a significant part of the island's ecology and conservation efforts, drawing attention to the importance of preserving these beautiful creatures and their natural habitat. These majestic creatures find their nesting grounds along Zakynthos' pristine shores, with Navagio Beach notably serving as a vital site for their annual egg-laying ritual. Throughout the late spring and summer, these gentle creatures return to the sandy beaches under the cover of night, delicately burying their eggs in the warm sands.</p>
